      <h3>The Elements of Citizenship</h3>
      <p>1. Honesty is when one always tells the truth. It is important
      because one who has this quality can be trusted.</p>
      <p>2. Compassion is when one has sympathy towards others.
      It's key because nobody likes a stone cold being with no empathy.</p>
      <p>3. Respect is when one has admiration for another. It is essential to
      have respect for someone else because then you have a role model.</p>
      <p>4. Responsibility is when one has authority over certain people or
      actions. Being responsible shows that one is capable and a leader.</p>
      <p>5. Courage is when one is brave. This shows that one is fearless,
      confident, and capable.</p>
      <p>Another essential qualituy of a good citizen is STRENGTH.This is when
      one has the willpower and discipline to stand tall in tough situations.
      This is key because sometimes other citizens may criticize you for who
      you are but you must have the strength to remain true to yourself.</p>
      <p>A great act of citizenship that I've heard about is a time where a
      homeless man discovered a bag of $50,000, but instead of taking it, he
      returned it to the police station. One would expect him to take it since
      he really needed it but he had the strength and respect to return the
      money to its rightful owner. He ended up being rewarded some money for his
      act of responsibility and discipline.</p>
