      <h1>Image Formats</h1>
      <p>GIFs: these are great for when there are large areas of solid colors with small amounts of gradients. Using few colors is not good for this.Got low file size, great for real life scene.
      <p>JPGs: these are best for graphics with a high complexity of effects, which include shadows, gradients. They have a wide range of colors. By increasing the "blur" one decreases the file size. Watch for image preview and file size.
      <p>PNGs: two options for these in photoshop, PNG-8 and PNG-24. Using PNG-8 color settings is similar to using GIF. PNG-24 have much higher quality. Have small file size, and not supported by all web browsers.
